# Summer School

We announce the sixth Summer School on Biological and Medical Visualization: the **Bio+Med+Vis Summer School**!

The Summer School will be held on **September 15th, 2026 in Ljubljana, Slovenia**. The event is collocated with [EG VCBM conference](http://vcbm.org/) in Ljubljana, Slovenia (16. - 18.09.2026). Participants can anticipate excellent **talks and practical tutorials**, given by experts in Biological and Medical Visualization.

The Summer School is primarily targeting M.Sc. and Ph.D. students, but anyone who wants to learn more about principles and challenges in visualization for Life Sciences applications is welcome! No preliminary knowledge of Bio+Medical visualization is necessary.

The students can obtain a certificate of attendance. Based on the rules of the student’s home institution, the participant may be able to obtain ECTS points for participating at the Bio+Med+Vis School. However, as different institutions have different requirements, it is impossible for us to unify this process. Therefore, we are leaving it up to the discretion of the mentor/supervisor/institution to decide granting ECTS for participation at the Bio+Med+Vis School.

We are looking forward to seeing you at the Bio+Med+Vis Summer School!
