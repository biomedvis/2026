# The Story of Bio+Med+Vis School

Following the paradigm of online education during COVID-19 pandemic, we started an initiative across institutions for an **educational Bio+Med+Vis platform**. The purpose is to build a growing curriculum that will **bridge** the domains of biological, medical, and biomedical visualization. Study materials from diverse fields in Bio+Med+Vis will be collected at different levels of detail and with varying required preliminary knowledge. 

As a starting point, we organized the first fully ***virtual Bio+Med+Vis*** Spring School in 2021, which offered a set of talks on various visualization subjects from prestigious and established Bio+Med+Vis researchers, addressing different Life Sciences domains. This initiative then continued as a hybrid and in-person events in ***Brno, Czechia (2022)***, ***Norrköping, Sweden (2023)***, and ***Magdeburg, Germany (2024)***. This year the event is collocated with the EG VCBM conference, which will be held on October 2nd-3rd in Delft, The Netherlands.

The Bio+Med+Vis School is a unique opportunity for students to meet experts from all facets of our field. The School is primarily targeting the M.Sc. and Ph.D. students in Computer Science, who want to learn more about the principles, the diversity of topics, and open challenges in visualization for Life Sciences applications. It is an excellent opportunity to meet world-leading experts in these domains, and discuss with them within open sessions. The students can also inform themselves about open positions for Ph.D. studies, providing them an opportunity to connect with top visualization teams.

The students can obtain a **certificate of attendance**. Based on the rules of the student’s home institution, the participant may be able to obtain ECTS points for participating at the Bio+Med+Vis School. However, as different institutions have different requirements, it is impossible for us to unify this process. Therefore, we are leaving it up to the discretion of the mentor/supervisor/institution to decide granting ECTS for participation at the Bio+Med+Vis School.
